110,Bacteremia can cause disseminated lesions similar to those of purpura fulminans .
111,"Ritter von Rittershain called it dermatitis exfoliativa neonatorum , and it is also known as pemphigus neonatorum because it more frequently affects newborn infants and because of its bullous appearance ."
112,Two types of epidermolytic toxins exist—A and B—which are produced by staphylococci and are responsible for destructive lesions in the skin and affect the granular layer causing cellular separation .
113,"The toxins elicit specific antibodies that have been found in up to 75 % of persons older than 10 , which would explain the absence of the lesions in adults ."
114,One or two days later bullous lesions appear which have a very thin wall which is easily broken allowing a clear serous or sometimes purulent fluid to escape .
115,"It should not be confused with poorly treated burns on children where there is a history of trauma nor with bullous epidermolysis , incontinentia pigmenti or even with erysipelas ."
116,The lesions do not usually leave scars .
117,"It should not be forgotten that the original focus resides in an extracutaneous bacterial location , which must be identified and adequately eliminated ."

139,"They are destructive gummas that ulcerate and leave atrophic scars , often geometrical ."
140,"On radiology , osteoperiostitis can be seen , especially involving the tibia ."
141,"The development of a vaccine is the hope of the future.There have been massive and effective campaigns to combat this disease , and in some places it has been eradicated ."
142,"In order to avoid scar retraction , it is important to aspirate the affected lymph nodes ; they should not be drained ."
143,"Because it causes ulcerous lesions , its control constitutes a method to decrease the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( Genitourin Med 1995 ; 71:27-31 ) ."
144,This disease does not have a tendency to heal spontaneously .
145,"Woman are asymptomatic reservoir , and babies born of infected mothers can have the disease ."
146,In the homosexual man it can be present as a rectal infection with bloody diarrhea and tenesmus .
147,It drains to the surface through numerous sinus tracts ; it does not have a tendency to scar .
148,"In some cases other lymph node groups can be affected , e.g . , the axillary and cervical ."
149,Fluctuant and soft bubos can be drained ; this can improve the course .
150,"Drainage should be performed from the inferior part of the bubo upwards with a large , thick needle inserted through uninvolved skin to avoid the formation of fistulae ."
151,The body louse has a thin skin which requires humidity and the heat of its host in order to survive .
152,"If we consider that the average hair growth is 1 cm a month , the distance from the scalp at which we will find the nits indicates the time of the parasitation ."
153,"For example , body lice live on fabric , especially in people who do not change their clothing , a vital factor in their survival ."
154,We have found out that up to 33 % of the school children in suburban and rural areas may be infested .
155,This contradicts the study which reports infestation to be common in children with clean and short hair ( Head Lice Advice .
156,"If a white cloth is place under the head of an infested child and a finetoothed comb is drawn through the hair , lice , easily nits or ova , and a black powder-like lice feces will fall ."
157,"Pruritis is the main symptom , although with secondary infection there may be pain , fever , malaise and lymphadenopathy ."
158,"To confirm the diagnosis , meticulous examination of the clothing will reveal lice and nits ."
159,Pubic lice cause severe pruritus that is difficult to ignore .
160,"In hirsute individuals infestation may spread to the perianal and gluteal area , axilla , chest , back and umbilicus ."
161,It may also involve the beard and mustache .
162,"Children can become infested by sleeping with their parents or other affected people , not necessarily by sexual transmission ."

168,A surface biopsy can be performed after applying a drop of cyanoacrylate .
169,Tunnels can be seen after applying India ink to the lesion and then cleaning the skin with alcohol .
170,"If a solution of tetracycline is applied in the same way , the tunnels can be seen under a Wood ’ s lamp ."
171,"In rural areas where medications are not available or are too expensive to purchase , vaseline or petrolatum with sulfur 5 % can be applied for four consecutive nights followed by a daily morning bath ."
172,"The medication should be repeated for one week if there are persistent lesions on the hands , feet and genitals ."
173,Patients must be instructed about measures to prevent re-infestations .
174,The patient should be instructed that symptoms can persist for several days after treatment .
175,The administration of medication should be described in written instructions so that accurate information can be available to the patient ’ s family .
176,The nematode can not complete its life cycle in man .
177,They lack the capacity to cross the basal layer in the epidermis due to lack of essential collagenases or due to the host immune response ( Actas Dermosif 1987 ; 78:751-52 ) .
178,All of these worms normally parasitize other mammals and reach human skin by accident .
179,For some time they reside in the kidney until they finally return to the stomach wall where the cycle begins again .
180,"Although it is not usual , it is thought that man can act as a permanent host ."
181,These last can not complete their life cycle in humans .
182,The internal ( endogenous ) asexual cycle does not have to be outside the host to develop .
183,Vesicles or blisters can accompany the initial lesion or its track .
184,Skin is the most frequently involved organ and the easiest to detect : 1 ) The inflammatory form or migratory panniculitis is of variable intensity .
185,"The surface is warm , painful or burning , with and orange-like aspect to the skin , and they can displace from 1-5 cm daily ( Fig ."
186,"They frequently present around the anus and in the gluteal area and can affect the lumbar , pelvic and thoracic regions ."
187,In humans the larva make tunnels into the epidermis and form linear tracks that progress from 1-2 cm daily .
188,Cryotherapy or the direct extraction of fly larvae with a sterilized needle may constitute an adequate treatment ( Piel 1989 ; 4:309-18 ) .
189,"Tungiasis is rarely diagnosed in Italy or in other European countries or North America , so it can really be considered a “ tourism-transmitted ” disease , contracted by tourists in endemic areas ."
190,Infestation may be contracted from sandy soil in areas inhabited by these animals .
191,The usual black dots may then become inflammatory nodules .
192,This will immediately reveal a cluster of eggs ( Fig .
193,"The removal of a chick-flea , for example , leaves a hole through which the tetanus spore can penetrate : this accounted for 25 % of the cases ( 11 cases ) ."
194,"Nevertheless , any open , poorly treated wound can support larvae ."
195,Without treatment this stage lasts 3-4 months and heals when the larva is expelled .
196,"If this is not adequate , mature flies can be obtained by application of meat to the lesion ."
197,"Larvae invade the meat which is placed in a ventilated , closed jar with sawdust on which the pupae will fall and will permit development of mature flies for identification ."
198,"Tropical Dermatology In isolated areas where there is no medication , wounds should be cleaned with soap and water ."
199,Vaseline can be applied to the wound to promote larval death or withdrawal from the wound .
200,In some forms of migratory myiasis the larvae can be visualized and removed with a needle .
201,"They may cause either a sub-clinical or self-limited infection , the localized cutaneous form which has a lymphocytic response or as a diffuse form if the infection spreads ."
202,"Both affect areas exposed to insect bites such as the face , trunk , and extremities ."
203,"The incubation period varies from 1-4 weeks , but it may be several years ."
204,It may last many years and does not respond well to treatment .
205,"Leishmaniasis recidiva cutis may represent a reactivation of an initial infection , probably due to the persistence of parasites and is considered by some authors as synonymous with lupoid leishmaniasis ."
206,It can heal spontaneously after a long time and leave a disfiguring Fig .
207,"Another medication , pentostam ( sodium stibogluconate ) 20 mg/kg/day may be given for 20 days ."
208,"Through different ways , it may invade the skin where it causes painful , rapidly growing necrotic ulcers ."
209,Most cases affect adults of both sexes ; it is rare in children although in nursing infants with diarrhea amebiasis must be considered .
210,"It can survive in this form for several days , contaminating food and water and invading new hosts ."
211,"When the parasite gains access to the blood or lymphatic circulations , it may reach the viscera and skin ( Int J Dermatol 1982 ; 21:472-5 ) ."
212,Tropical Dermatology Amoeba are usually found microscopically from fresh material taken from the base of the ulcer and placed on a glass slide to which warm saline solution is added to stimulate movement .
213,"On biopsy of the edge of the lesion , trophozoites may be seen ."
214,Emetine 1mg/kg/day for 10 days and dehydroemetine is given intramuscular not to exceed 60 mg daily because of its cardiac effects .
215,T. cruzei can live intra- and extracellularly .
216,They re-enter in the circulation and repeat the cycle .
217,This lesion may last 1-2 months .
218,Males as well as females bite and may transmit the parasite .
219,"In the host skin , they multiply , mature and migrate to the lymph nodes ."
220,"Also the initial lesion may present as a papular eruption accompanied by peripheral edema or , if on the face , as painful palpebral erythema and urticaria ."
221,"The diagnosis of both forms may be difficult , especially in travelers from non-endemic areas where physicians are not familiar with this illness ."
222,Feeding insects take up the parasite larvae from the skin and deposit them on other individuals .
223,It is found between 100-1500 m altitude and it can travel 5 km in 2-3 days .
224,"Skin subcutaneous lesions occur on or near the joints , on the head and upper trunk , but may also occur on the buttocks , in the sacrococcygeal region and the lower extremities ( onchocercomas ) ."
225,"The ocular involvement , occurring in 50 % of cases , is caused by microfilariae in the anterior and posterior chambers and may cause choroidoretinal atrophy ."
226,"There is intense pruritus in the face , neck , upper trunk and proximal extremities ; anxiety can be severe ."
227,"Slit lamp examination can reveal microfilariae in the anterior chamber , cornea and lens ."
228,"Cutaneous biopsy should be obtained with a curved scissor , scalpel or razor blade ; snips of 0.5 x 1 cm should include epidermis and dermis ."
229,"After rending the skin samples , they are observed under the microscope with saline solution to look for microfilariae ."
230,They may be fixed with alcohol and stained with Giemsa .
231,A negative biopsy does not rule out the diagnosis .
232,Hematoxylin and eosin staining can demonstrate microfilariae in the dermis and hypodermis with the usual markers of inflammation ( Fig .
233,It is able to control the disease which remains transmisibile ; it also diminishes the ocular damage as it destroys larvae very slowly .
234,Both trigger Mazzotti ’ s reaction in 88 % of cases in 24 hr and may be used as a diagnostic test .
235,"49 Onchocerciasis Because of this , many patients do not follow the prescription ."
236,dozen filarias can cause illness in man .
237,The family has eight groups of genes ( T1-T8 ) and at least four of them can be identified in a species .
238,This stage can last up to four weeks ; it ends when the adult parasites are eliminated from the intestine .
239,The newborn larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the lymph and blood circulations from where they invade muscle .
240,It may reach 40°C and can last up to 2 weeks .
241,This is perhaps the only parasitosis that may be eradicated .
242,"According to the World Health Organization , this will be accomplished by the end of this century ."
243,Ingested larvae reach the human intestinal tract and migrate to the lymphatics and subsequently reside in the subcutaneous tissue where they mature in 8-12 months .
244,"Tropical Dermatology Until the parasite reaches the skin , the host can be asymptomatic ."
245,The wound can be the entry point of tetanus as well .
246,The proglotides are discharged in the feces or migrate outside the intestine .
247,They may remain unchanged for many years or may calcify ( Arch Dermatol 1978 ; 114:107-108 ) .
248,"In general , individuals with antibodies against HSV-1 do not have genital lesions ."
249,Antibodies do not prevent viral reactivation and the highest titers are reported in individuals with frequent episodes of recurrences .
250,"In adults , it may be caused by HSV-2 , and it follows digital-genital contact ."
